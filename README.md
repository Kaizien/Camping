# Camping


This repository contains the Unity Project codebase for the Tech Hoppers Girl Scout troop's wilderness and camping themed video game. The current codebase is a work in progress and will continue to be updated over the coming months.

This project and the Tech Hoppers are affiliated with Cornell Tech (Cornell University's Graduate School of Engineering in New York City) located on Roosevelt Island in New York City.
